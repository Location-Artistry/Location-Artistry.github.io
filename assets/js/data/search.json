Anyone who is a little famililar with web development has certainly made use of W3schools for html/javascript/css help. They provide simple examples with a built-in code testing tool. W3CSS is similar to bootstrap, though an even basic template for creating a nice looking website. While this worked well enough to make changes to the site on a daily basis, it was not ideal for quickly updating the site with text and image based posts. Additionally the template does not auto generate links within the site to each posts, allow for searching, generate tags etc… which makes it look and feel less like a “true” website.Hosting for the old site was done with gitHub pages, a completely free method for hosting, pulling the code directly from your repository. This is a great trick for deploying a fast and cheap website, and I’ve used for projects such as the 30 Day Map Challenge, portfolio’s, and Mapbox Story Maps. It works very well for stripped down sites not using web frameworks or other fancy implementations.something newWhile I’ve shared notebooks on ObservableHQ, created sites hosted on gitHub pages, and tagged things with #locationVisualization, the natrame of my blog, I’ve never put together a cohesive website as a home for the blog er thing(is blog an outdated term in 2022?). It would nice to be able to goto one location where you could find all of the previous posts and links to projects. The site did not need to be super fancy, or perfect, but having some basic navigation/search built in would be VERY HANDY. Additionally, I’ve been completely obsessed with markdown for some time now. I love the simplicity and power of markdown, to quickly edit text in an uncluttered manner, and apply stylish formatting that compiles into html. I use Obsidian, a lovely markdown based text editor as my primary note taking/document application, and I’ve been very interested in using markdown for web site editing…gitHub pages with jekyll!Have you ever noticed when creating a gitHub pages site, it asks about if you are using jekyll themes? Being curious I thought to invesitage a little further. So try not to freak out too much, but jekyll sites are based on… RUBY ON RAILS! Ah the horror! Wasn’t that some hipster language that died like 10 years ago? Nah, in honestly there are plenty of modern interfaces that still use Ruby (list of outdated services here).I was a but surprised the more I started reading about Jekyll, and Ruby Gems, and Ruby Emeralds (that’s not a real thing). This whole gitHub pages thing is going to be easy right? Jekyll just sounds cool right! I’m doing this because I don’t need to learn a bunch of new technologies and just want to get writing in Markdown eh???chromebook + linux = WHY?Without elaborating, I’ll save that for an entire new category, I’ve been experimenting running Linux on chromebooks for the last couple years. I’ve wiped chromeOS, flashed the ROM, crashed the ROM, and installed antiX Linux most recently. This is all on a few Toshiba 4GB RAM 16GM HD chromebooks from around 2015-16? I’ve learned tons about linux, bash, and working on extremely lightweight and limited systems. I was on holiday with my happy little portable toshiba, and wanted to do some writing on that system.starting with jekyllllllThe first place I went was here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ Seemed like a logical place to start. Began by apt package manager installs of ruby, gems, jekyll, working with kiddo, she felt like a real hacker typing in bash and watching all of the installs scroll along the terminal. This was went fantastic, I’ve got ruby, installing the gems, which I believe are semi-equivalent to node npm package manager, jekyll build and serve, and success! Wow I’ve got this thing running with ruby on the chromebook, serving the jekyll site, let’s try to add one of these github pages supported jekyll themes.This is where things started to breakdown. No matter how much I changed the gemfile or config.yaml, I was unable to get the theme to work. Both locally and with the a gitHub pages deployment. Surfed through some of the docs, attempted a number of other apt and gem install and it just didn’t work…gihub pages docsSo let’s try starting over again from scratch, using the docs directly from github One by one making sure we ruby, and gems, and oh now we also nt eed agem install bundlerYou can find docs for bundler here: - https://bundler.io/Thus began a never-ending quest to install the dependencies needed to serve my jekyll site, which to break the suspense also failed. One after the other I tried to chase the dependencies that bundler was lacking, even considering that I might be running out of home drive space on the chromebook antiX setup. I tried these gems:gem install minimagem install http_parser.rgem install github-pagesMinima was the theme I was hoping for, a very basic jekyll look, but still no dice getting ruby, jekyll, and bundler sync’ed up.yet another approachAfter several hours/days of attempts it was time to mo" }, { "title": "Hello Earth", "url": "/posts/hello-earth/", "categories": "locationVisualization, blog", "tags": "locationVisualization, discuss", "date": "2022-06-26 05:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "locationVisualizationDevelopments in GeoSpatial(Data)Science, GeoTech &amp; ToolsA Space for the Geospatial Community to learn and discuss.helloEarth = 'Hello Geo Friends\"print(f'Welcome and {helloEarth}')" }, { "title": "30DayMapChallenge 2021", "url": "/posts/30DayMapChallenge/", "categories": "locationVisualization, pastPost", "tags": "locationVisualization, discuss, 30DayMapChallenge, maps, geospatial, community, GISchat, python, jupyter", "date": "2021-11-01 01:00:00 -0400", "snippet": "Link to personal 30 Day Map Challenge site from 2021.
